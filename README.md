## CodePDE

This is the official implementation for [CodePDE: An Inference Framework for LLM-driven PDE Solver Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08783), the first inference framework for generating PDE solvers using large language models (LLMs).

### Dependencies

The required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`, which can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

### Getting started

Data can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LDA1020/codepde-data/tree/main). For each PDE, there is a development set for agent feedback and development and a test set for final evaluation.

Set up the configurations in `config` and run `python main.py`.

In the _repeated sampling_ mode, the LLM generates solvers from scratch.

In the _refinement_ mode, the LLM uses existing solvers in the `solvers` folder as "seeds" (e.g., `solvers/burgers/nu_0.01/seeds` for Burgers Equation with $\nu=0.01$) and tries to improve upon the "seeds".

In the _funsearch_ mode, the LLM uses a few solvers generated in the _repeated sampling_ stage to warm start the program database and then generates new solvers via evolutionary search. The implementation assumes that the _repeated sampling_ results are stored under `../archived_logs`.
